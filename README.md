# PubAdVibe: The Aesthetic Intelligence Layer

**PubAdVibe** is a high-end security command center for premium publishers. It leverages multimodal AI to ensure every pixel served on your site matches your brand's unique energy and visual identity.

## 🎤 The Pitch
Standard ad-tech is blind to brand safety—it blocks scripts, but it can’t see the pixels. **PubAdVibe** is the first **Aesthetic Intelligence Layer** for the premium web, powered by the multimodal reasoning of **Gemini 3 Pro**. While traditional filters only catch malware, PubAdVibe audits the 'soul' of an advertisement.

## ⚡ Technical Spotlight: The "Scan Network" Protocol
The **Scan Network** feature is a high-fidelity simulation of an autonomous security agent. It demonstrates the product vision of an "at-the-edge" proxy that protects sites from programmatic rot.

### Current Implementation (The Prototype)
- **System Override Mode**: The UI locks into a "Pulse Gateway" state, simulating a high-priority network sweep.
- **Live Telemetry**: Generates randomized hex-codes and real-time counters (e.g., "500 Creatives Audited") to visualize the speed of a theoretical edge-audit.
- **Autonomous Remediation**: Upon completion, the agent generates an aggregate report summarizing the "toxins" purged (Deepfakes, UI traps, and Harmony violations).

### The Production Roadmap (What's Missing)
To move from a prototype to a production-grade utility, the following engineering gaps are currently being addressed:
1.  **Real Batch Processing**: Replacing simulated progress with an asynchronous `Promise.allSettled` loop that processes real ad feeds via the Gemini 3 Pro multimodal endpoint.
2.  **Gateway Interceptor**: A server-side or Service Worker layer to wrap `adsbygoogle.js` or `Prebid.js`, intercepting ad responses at the network level before they enter the DOM.
3.  **Predictive Vibe-Scoring (Caching)**: A vector database (like Pinecone) to cache the "Aesthetic Score" of known ad creatives, ensuring the same 7-Up ad isn't scanned 1,000 times across different sessions.
4.  **Live Feed Integration**: Logic to dynamically push threats detected during the "Network Scan" into the History Feed for manual review.

## 🌟 The Narrative

### Inspiration
The internet is suffering from "programmatic rot." High-end publishers spend years building a "Zen" brand, only to have a programmatic ad network serve a neon-flashing, high-stress trading scam that shatters user trust. We were inspired by the idea that a website's aesthetic is its most valuable asset. We wanted to build a "Moral Compass" for the ad-stack.

### What it does
PubAdVibe acts as a visual firewall. It ingests ad creative assets and uses **Gemini 3 Pro** to perform a three-tier audit:
1.  **Aesthetic Harmony**: Does this ad fit the brand's "Vibe Manifesto" (e.g., minimalism vs. high-stress)?
2.  **Deceptive UI Detection**: It "looks" for fake 'X' buttons or system dialogs embedded in images that standard code scanners miss.
3.  **Policy Guard (RAF 2026)**: It scans for synthetic deepfake endorsements and fraudulent visual tropes.

### How we built it
We built a modern, premium stack using **React 19** and **Tailwind CSS**, centered around the **Gemini 3 Pro Preview** model. We leveraged Gemini’s strict JSON output capabilities to turn subjective "vibes" into objective data points. By using a custom-engineered prompt that injects a site's "Brand Manifesto" as context, we turned a generic LLM into a specialized Brand Safety Officer.

### Challenges we ran into
Defining "vibes" in a way an AI can quantify was our greatest hurdle. We had to iterate on prompt engineering to ensure the model didn't just flag ads for being "ugly," but specifically for "violating brand-specific constraints." We also tackled the technical challenge of real-time multimodal ingestion.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are incredibly proud of our **Deceptive UI Heuristic**. During testing, PubAdVibe successfully identified "pixel-traps" (fake close buttons) that passed traditional code-based security audits. Seeing the "Revenue Protected" counter tick up as the AI "purged" visual toxins felt like a true milestone for a cleaner web.

### What we learned
We learned that the future of web security isn't just in the code—it's in the **visual experience**. Code-analysis is no longer enough to protect users from sophisticated AI-generated scams. To protect the web, we need AI that can "see" and "reason" like a human.

### What's next for PubAdVibe
Our next step is the **Gateway Proxy**: a server-side implementation that intercepts AdSense and Header Bidding responses at the edge, performing the Vibe-Check before the ad ever hits the user's browser. We envision a web where every premium publisher has an "Aesthetic Intelligence" layer protecting their soul and their revenue.
